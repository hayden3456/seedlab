# EENG350-Team4-Control
Dedicated repo for SEED Lab Team 4, Fall 2024. We are creating an automated robot that can use computer vision to see direction markers to navigate through the world.    

We have the repo organized by time mile markers for the SEED lab course. Under any given mile marker we have the repo organized into the code running on the PI and the code running on the Arduino.
